# Chips Project 
The Category Manager for Chips, who wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour and trend within the region.
The insights from your analysis will feed into the supermarketâ€™s strategic plan for the chip category in the next half year.

DATA CLEANING AND PREPOCESSING
I looked for inconsistencies, missing data across the data set, outliers, correctly identified category items, numeric data across all tables with excel.
I also checked for similar issues in the customer data, look for nulls. By utilizing SQL, i created databases of the transaction and customer data.
I queried the two databases and merged them together using the joins functions. I explored the data, create charts and graphs with tableau as well as noting any interesting trends
and/or insights by looking at total sales, drivers of sales, where the highest sales are coming from etc
