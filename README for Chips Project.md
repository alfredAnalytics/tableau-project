# Chips Project 
The Category Manager for Chips, who wants to better understand the types of customers who purchase Chips and their purchasing behaviour and trend within the region.
The insights from the analysis will feed into the supermarketâ€™s strategic plan for the chip category in the next half year.

DATA CLEANING AND PREPROCESSING
In the initial data preparation phase, a comprehensive data cleaning and preprocessing procedure was conducted to ensure data integrity and accuracy. The following steps were taken:

1. **Data Validation:** An extensive validation process was executed to identify and rectify inconsistencies, missing data, and outliers across the entire dataset. This encompassed verifying the correctness of categorical items and validating numeric data within all tables using Excel.

2. **Customer Data Scrutiny:** In the customer data subset, a thorough examination was performed to detect and address any null or missing values. SQL was employed to establish dedicated databases for both transaction and customer data.

3. **Database Integration:** To facilitate a comprehensive analysis, a database query was initiated, consolidating the transaction and customer data through SQL joins. This unified dataset was then subjected to rigorous exploration.

4. **Data Exploration and Visualization:** Utilizing Tableau, the integrated data underwent a detailed exploratory analysis, culminating in the creation of insightful charts and graphs. This phase also involved identifying notable trends and patterns within the dataset, with a particular focus on total sales, drivers of sales, and geographic sales distribution.

TRENDS AND INSIGHTS
The data-driven analysis yielded the following pivotal insights:

1. **Robust Sales Performance:** A substantial total sales figure of $1,934,904 was attained over two quarters, driven by transactions from 72,637 customers and encompassing 114 distinct chip varieties.

2. **Customer Segmentation:** The customer base demonstrated distinct segmentation, with retirees constituting the largest customer segment and new families representing the smallest group.

3. **Top-Selling Chip:** The "Dorito Corn Chip Supreme" emerged as the best-selling chip, contributing 2.9% to the overall sales revenue.

4. **Sales and Quantity Averages:** The average sales and product quantities were $483,602.25 and 126,280.5 units, respectively.

5. **Demographic Impact:** Notably, the highest sales were attributed to older single/couples, while new families exhibited the lowest sales performance.

6. **Brand Preferences:** Older single/couples displayed a propensity for premium brands, while young singles/couples favored a mix of both cheap and premium options.

RECOMMENDATIONS
The analysis underscores the significance of "LIFESTAGES" as a key customer attribute influencing purchasing behavior. To optimize sales in the forthcoming quarter, the following recommendations are proposed:

1. **Targeted Marketing:** Given that older single/couples and retirees have shown a proclivity for higher sales and premium brands, targeted marketing strategies should be directed toward these segments. Special promotions and tailored offers can be designed to further engage and satisfy these customer groups.

2. **Product Assortment:** To cater to the diverse preferences observed among different customer segments, consider expanding the product assortment to include a variety of both premium and cost-effective chip options. This can help capture a wider customer base.

3. **Data Refinement:** Continue to refine and enrich the dataset to enhance future analyses. Collect additional data points related to customer demographics, preferences, and feedback to gain deeper insights into customer behavior.

4. **Customer Engagement:** Implement customer engagement initiatives, such as loyalty programs or feedback mechanisms, to foster stronger relationships with the customer base. Understanding their evolving needs and preferences is crucial for sustained growth.

By adhering to these recommendations and maintaining a data-driven approach, the company can further optimize its sales strategies and enhance customer satisfaction.
